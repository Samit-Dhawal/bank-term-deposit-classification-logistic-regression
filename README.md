# Bank Term Deposit Classification - Logistic Regression

A machine learning project that predicts whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit based on client demographics, contact information, and previous campaign data using logistic regression classification.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Bank Term Deposit Classification - Python, Machine Learning, Logistic Regression, Scikit-learn**

* **Challenge**: A bank required an automated system to predict client subscription likelihood for term deposits based on demographic data, contact history, and previous campaign outcomes to optimize marketing strategies.

* **Solution**: Engineered a logistic regression classification model with comprehensive feature analysis and correlation study, implementing advanced data preprocessing and model evaluation techniques.

* **Impact**: Achieved 89% accuracy with ROC-AUC score of 0.57, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and reducing customer acquisition costs through data-driven client segmentation.

## üìä Dataset Overview

The project utilizes a comprehensive bank marketing dataset with 17 attributes including:

### Client Demographics
- **Age**: Numeric client age
- **Job**: Professional category (12 categories)
- **Marital Status**: Relationship status
- **Education**: Educational background level
- **Default**: Credit default status
- **Balance**: Average yearly balance in euros

### Contact Information
- **Housing**: Housing loan status
- **Loan**: Personal loan status
- **Contact**: Communication type (telephone/cellular)
- **Day/Month**: Last contact timing
- **Duration**: Contact duration in seconds

### Campaign Data
- **Campaign**: Number of contacts in current campaign
- **Pdays**: Days since last contact from previous campaign
- **Previous**: Previous campaign contact count
- **Poutcome**: Previous campaign outcome

### Target Variable
- **y**: Term deposit subscription (binary: "yes"/"no")

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for logistic regression
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization and correlation analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment

## üìà Model Performance

### Classification Metrics
- **Overall Accuracy**: 89%
- **ROC-AUC Score**: 0.57
- **Precision (Class 0)**: 0.90
- **Recall (Class 0)**: 0.98
- **F1-Score (Class 0)**: 0.94
- **Precision (Class 1)**: 0.57
- **Recall (Class 1)**: 0.16
- **F1-Score (Class 1)**: 0.25

### Model Insights
